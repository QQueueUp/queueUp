## Overview
### Description
QueueUp, an app to make people wait in the line in a safer environment during these hard times. 

Every store will have an account in this app to let their customers know how many people are there in the store currently, is there a waiting line and how many people are in the line etc. Every customer who wants to go in to the store can check before hands if store is available. As customers go in, store will update their system. 

If the store that customers want to go in has reached its max capacity, the app will put them in a queue for that store and make people wait in their cars or even ath their homes. By creating a virtual queue, the app can help people tp keep their distance from each other and create safer waiting line environment.
